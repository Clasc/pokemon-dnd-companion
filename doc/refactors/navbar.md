Create a responsive navigation system with a bottom tab bar for mobile and a sidebar for desktop. On mobile, include 3–5 tabs with icons and text labels, optimized for thumb reach, where active states are clearly highlighted. On desktop, transform the bottom bar into a vertical sidebar on the left, maintaining the same navigation items, hierarchy, and visual styling for consistency across devices.
