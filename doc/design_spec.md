# Design Language for the Pokémon & D&D Companion App
This design language is based on the core concept of being simple yet dynamic, using gradients and blurs to create an aesthetic that is easy on the eyes. The app prioritizes mobile and tablet optimization and supports both a light and dark theme, with the dark theme as the default.

> **Current design reference**: `mockup-4-final.html` at the project root is the canonical visual reference for all design decisions. The dashboard implements a tactical monospace aesthetic with zinc-tone surfaces, amber/orange interactive accents, and dense information layouts optimized for in-session use.

## 5. Tactical Dashboard Design (Current)

The Session Dashboard (`/dashboard`) is the primary in-game interface. It follows a tactical, data-dense mobile-first design optimized for quick actions during tabletop play.

### Design Principles
- **Glance, don't read**: All critical information (HP, status, attacks, XP) visible at zero taps
- **Tap target separation**: Every data point has its own action — no overlapping touch zones
- **Consistent sheet pattern**: All editing happens in BottomSheets; no page transitions during play
- **Progressive disclosure**: Summary on cards, full details behind header tap

### Layout
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│ TRAINER STRIP            │  Name, class, level, team status dots
│ HP / ₽okédollars / Items │  Each cell tappable independently
│ STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA  │  Attributes row tappable

### Interaction Model

| Target | Action |
|---|---|
| Card header row (chevron) | Opens `PokemonExpandedModal` |
| HP bar | Opens `StatAdjustSheet` |
| XP underline (under level) | Opens `StatAdjustSheet` |
| Status badge | Opens `QuickStatusDropdown` |
| Attack pill (tap) | Decrements PP |
| Attack pill (long-press/right-click) | Opens `AttackQuickEditSheet` (PP+/-, Replace) |
| + Add attack slot | Opens `AddAttackModal` |
| Trainer header row | Opens `TrainerSheet` |
| Trainer HP cell | Opens trainer HP quick adjust |
| Trainer ₽okédollars cell | Inline number input |
| Trainer Items cell | Opens inventory |
| Trainer attributes row | Opens `TrainerSheet` |

### Visual States

| State | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Healthy (no condition) | Gray "● Status" placeholder badge |
| Status condition | Colored dot + condition name (Poisoned, Burned, etc.) |
| Confused | Secondary smaller "● Conf" badge alongside primary |
| Low HP (<25%) | Red HP bar, red numbers, bold HP label |
| Medium HP (25-50%) | Yellow HP bar |
| High HP (>50%) | Green HP bar, green numbers |
| Fainted | Grayscale sprite, strikethrough name, empty HP bar, all attacks disabled, "● Fainted" badge |

### Typography
- **Card body**: `'Courier New', monospace` for the tactical tabletop feel
- **Page chrome**: System sans-serif (`Inter`, `Poppins` for headings) per existing conventions
- **Size hierarchy**: 10px labels, 11px attack names, 14px names, consistent spacing

### Color Palette (Current Implementation)
- Surfaces: zinc-toned via `--color-surface` (`#222222`), `--color-bg` (`#1a1a1a`)
- Interactive: `--color-interactive` (`#EE5D20`) for buttons and focus rings
- XP/Accent: `--color-accent` (`#3B82F6`) for XP bar and progress indicators
- Type colors: Pokemon type palette (`TYPE_COLORS`)
- Status colors: Status condition palette (`STATUS_COLORS`)
- HP bar: Dynamic green/yellow/red based on percentage thresholds

### Editing Pattern: BottomSheet
All in-session editing uses the `BottomSheet` pattern (mobile) with `BaseModal` fallback on desktop:
- `PokemonExpandedModal` — full Pokémon detail/edit
- `StatAdjustSheet` — HP drag + XP input
- `AttackQuickEditSheet` — PP ±/restore/replace
- `TrainerSheet` — full trainer profile edit
- `AddAttackModal` — attack creation form

1. Visual Identity
Aesthetic Direction
The aesthetic blends the fantasy elements of Dungeons & Dragons with the vibrant energy of Pokémon. This is achieved through a mix of organic, flowing shapes and clean, structured layouts. The design should feel both magical and functional, like a well-organized spellbook.

Gradients: Use subtle, flowing gradients to add depth and visual interest. These shouldn't be overwhelming but rather a soft, atmospheric layer. A purple-to-blue gradient could be used for the background of a character page, while a red-to-orange gradient might appear in a health bar to signify low HP.

Blurs: Apply a frosted glass effect to pop-up menus, card backgrounds, and modals. This creates a sense of hierarchy and focus, making the content on top of the blur stand out.

Icons: Icons should be simple, clean, and symbolic rather than overly detailed. For example, a stylized sword for the "Attacks" section or a minimalist heart for HP.

Color Palette
The color palette is designed to be versatile for both light and dark themes while maintaining the magical D&D and vibrant Pokémon feel.

Dark Theme (Default):

Primary Background: A deep, dark blue or purple-grey (e.g., #1E1A2C) that feels like a night sky.

Accent Colors: Vibrant, saturated colors for UI elements, HP bars, and active states. Use a palette of colors inspired by Pokémon types, such as a fiery red (#E84B5B), a lightning-bolt yellow (#F9C51D), or a forest green (#5DB079).

Text & UI: A soft white (#F0F0F0) for primary text to ensure readability against the dark background. Lighter greys (#A0A0A0) for secondary information.

Light Theme:

Primary Background: A soft, off-white or light gray (#F5F5F7).

Accent Colors: The same vibrant accent colors from the dark theme, but slightly desaturated to be less jarring on a light background.

Text & UI: A deep charcoal gray (#333333) for primary text and a lighter gray for secondary information.

2. Typography & Layout
Typography
The font choice should balance readability with a hint of fantasy.

Main Font: A clean, modern sans-serif font like Poppins or Inter for all primary text, input fields, and labels. Its legibility is crucial for displaying game data.

Headers: A slightly more stylized, yet still readable, font like Oswald or Roboto Condensed for section titles and headers to give a nod to the fantasy genre without compromising clarity.

Layout & Structure
The layout is designed for easy, single-handed use on mobile devices and a clear overview on tablets.

Tabs/Sections: The main view is split into two clear, switchable sections: Trainer Overview and Pokémon Overview. On a tablet, these could be presented side-by-side.

Cards: All Trainer and Pokémon information should be contained within distinct, rounded "cards" with a slight drop shadow or blur effect. This visually separates information and makes it easy to scan.

Read-Only Mode: To prevent accidental changes, all fields are read-only by default. They should have a subtle, non-interactive visual style (e.g., a simple text display).

Edit Mode: Toggling the "Edit" button transforms the read-only displays into active input fields, each with a clear, focusable state (e.g., a glowing border). This transition should be smooth and immediate.

3. Interactive Elements
Buttons
Primary Actions: Main call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Edit," "Save") should be vibrant, solid-colored buttons with a subtle hover or press effect.

HP Adjustment: The "+" and "-" buttons for HP should be small, circular, and simple. The color of the button should reflect its function (e.g., green for "+" and red for "-").

Progress Bars
HP Bar: The HP bar for Pokémon should be a visual representation of the current health. It should have a gradient fill that changes color as HP decreases (e.g., full green, then yellow, then red as HP gets low). The bar should have a clear, rounded container to show the maximum HP.

XP Bar: The XP bar should be a simple, solid-colored bar (e.g., a vibrant green or blue) that fills up to show progress towards the next level. This should be a linear visual that fills smoothly.

Transitions
Transitions between screens should be fluid and not distract from the user's task. A simple slide-in or fade-in effect when a new view opens or a card expands is sufficient.

This design language creates a user experience that is both visually appealing and highly functional, perfectly suited for the needs of a D&D and Pokémon player. It provides a clean, clear way to manage stats, allowing players to stay focused on the game, not on the app.
